//! An implementation of a `ByteBuf` based on virtual memory.
//!
//! This implementation uses `VirtualAlloc` and `VirtualFree` on Windows systems.
//!
//! It reserves virtual memory up to `WASM_MAX_PAGES` for efficiency.
//!
//! This implementation is several orders of magnitudes faster than `vec_memory` implementation.
//!
//! NOTE: Pages in this source file refer to wasm32 pages which are defined by the spec as 64KiB in size.
