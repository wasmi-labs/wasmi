# Enables OS supported virtual memory.
#
# Note
#
# - This feature is only supported on 64-bit platforms.
#   For 32-bit platforms the linear memory will fallback to using the Vec
#   based implementation.
# - The default is to fall back is an inefficient vector based implementation.
# - By nature this feature requires `region` and the Rust standard library.
