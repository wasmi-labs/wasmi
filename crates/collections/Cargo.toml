# Tells the `wasmi_collections` crate to avoid using hash based maps and sets.
# 
# Some embedded environments cannot provide a random source which is required
# to properly initialize hashmap based data structures for resilience against
# malious actors that control their inputs.
#
# An example of such an environment is `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
