## 2024-02-07  -  Announcement: Transfer of Ownership

As of 2024-02-01, the original owner and maintainer of the Wasmi project, [Parity Technologies], has officially transferred ownership of the project to me, [Robin Freyler]. Since over 2 years I am the main developer and contributor for the project.

The goal of this transition is to find or create a new home in a non-profit organization with a focus on WebAssembly, virtualization or embeddeded environments. This should allow multiple Free Open Source Software (FOSS) stakeholders to collaborate on Wasmi's development and make the project more attractive to the FOSS community in general.

The core principles, objectives and licenses of Wasmi remain unchanged.

Feel free to reach out via e-mail to robin.freyler@gmail.com or via Wasmi's [discussions board] for questions or support.

Finally I want to thank [Parity Technologies] for their past involvement and support for the Wasmi project and to give me and the FOSS community the chance of taking the future of Wasmi into our own hands.
