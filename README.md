# Wasmi - WebAssembly (Wasm) Interpreter

<p align="center">
  <img src="./resources/wasmi-logo.png" width="100" height="100">
</p>

Wasmi is an efficient and lightweight WebAssembly interpreter for embedded systems.

At Parity we use Wasmi in the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk)
as the execution engine that runs WebAssembly based smart contracts.
Moreover, Wasmi is itself compiled to WebAssembly and executed inside of the [Wasmtime] sandbox for enhanced security.

[Wasmtime]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime

## Distinct Features

The following list states some of the distinct features of Wasmi.

- Simple, correct and deterministic execution of WebAssembly.
- Low-overhead and cross-platform WebAssembly runtime for embedded environments.
- JIT bomb resisting translation.
- Loosely mirrors the [Wasmtime API](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/).
- 100% WebAssembly spec testsuite compliance.
- Built-in support for fuel metering.

## WebAssembly Proposals

The new Wasmi engine supports a variety of WebAssembly proposals and will support even more of them in the future.

## Usage

### As CLI Application

Install the newest Wasmi CLI version:
```console
cargo install wasmi_cli
```
Run `wasm32-unknown-unknown` or `wasm32-wasi` Wasm binaries:
```console
wasmi_cli <WASM_FILE> --invoke <FUNC_NAME> [<FUNC_ARGS>]*
```

### As Rust Library

Refer to the [Wasmi crate docs](https://docs.rs/wasmi) to learn how to use the [Wasmi crate](https://crates.io/crates/wasmi) as library.

## Development

### Build & Test

Clone the Wasmi repository and build using `cargo`:

```console
git clone https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi.git --recursive
cd wasmi
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Benchmarks

In order to benchmark Wasmi use the following command:

```console
cargo bench
```

Use `translate`, `instantiate`, `execute` or `overhead` filters to only run benchmarks that test performance of Wasm translation, instantiation, execution or miscellaneous overhead respectively, e.g. `cargo bench execute`.

We maintain a timeline for benchmarks of every commit to `master` that [can be viewed here](https://paritytech.github.io/wasmi/benchmarks/).

## Supported Platforms

Wasmi supports a wide variety of architectures and platforms.

- Fore more details see this [list of supported platforms for Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustc/platform-support.html).
- **Note:** Wasmi can be used in `no_std` embedded environments, thus not requiring the standard library (`std`).
- Only some platforms are checked in CI and guaranteed to be fully working by the Wasmi maintainers.

## Production Builds

In order to reap the most performance out of Wasmi we highly recommended
to compile the Wasmi crate using the following Cargo `profile`:

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = "fat"
codegen-units = 1
```

When compiling for the WebAssembly target we highly recommend to post-optimize
Wasmi using [Binaryen]'s `wasm-opt` tool since our experiments displayed a
80-100% performance improvements when executed under Wasmtime and also
slightly smaller Wasm binaries.
