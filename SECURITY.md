# Reporting a vulnerability

If you identify a potential security vulnerability, we kindly request refraining from using the issue tracker or engaging in public discussions to mitigate the risk of exacerbating the situation. Such vulnerabilities should be promptly reported via email to: robin.freyler@gmail.com.

Please adhere to the following guidelines when reporting security concerns:

- Furnish a comprehensive report inclusive of reproducible steps and a clearly articulated impact.
- Limit each report to a single vulnerability.
- Social engineering tactics such as phishing, vishing, or smishing are not prohibited.

Upon receipt of your report, the Wasmi team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full announcement. We may seek additional details or guidance pertinent to the reported issue.

If you have not received a reply to your report within three days, we encourage you to reach out on our GitHub discussions board by posting a message.
